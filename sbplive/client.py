# ============================================================================
# The HTTP client: every tool call is one request to the running app under
# the token. Standard library only, so this module needs no SDK. The
# transport is a plain callable, which is how the tests run the tools
# against the app in-process.
#
# What the program refuses on its own ("match the software", the owner's
# answer on admin operations): nothing the API decides for the token's role.
# Tokens, users, backups, the company file and system go to the API like
# everything else, and its answer is what the person hears. One thing stays
# refused here: paths outside /api/ (and /openapi.json). The pages, /health
# and the payment and portal pages are not the API.
#
# Making a backup (POST /api/backups) is the API's to decide like the rest
# (the owner, 2026-11-06): the app lets a token an administrator ticked
# "Can make backups" make one whatever its role, and this program does not
# second-guess that.
#
# The files the API returns (PDFs, CSV and IIF downloads, print pages) and
# uploads are refused in operations.py, since they cannot be carried here.
#
# HTTPS certificates are always verified, with no switch to turn that off,
# and redirects are never followed: the token is sent only to the address
# the person gave setup.
